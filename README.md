# Tokyo Night Tmux
The world's best theme, but for tmux. Simple, clean, and easy on the eyes.
No other functionality other than looking good. Open a PR or fork if you want to add more functionality.
### Installation using TPM

In your `tmux.conf`:
```
set -g @plugin "garaiza-93/tokyo-night-tmux"
```
